[MQTTX](https://mqttx.app/): A `Powerful` and `All-in-One` MQTT 5.0 Client Toolbox for Desktop, CLI, and WebSocket. Developed by EMQ, this cross-platform tool streamlines the testing and development of MQTT-based applications.

> [MQTT](https://mqtt.org/faq) stands for MQ Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe, straightforward, lightweight messaging protocol designed for constrained devices and low bandwidth, high latency, or unreliable networks.

## üöÄ Get Started

MQTTX simplifies working with MQTT Brokers. For a complete understanding and detailed guidance:

**üìñ [Explore MQTTX Documentation](https://mqttx.app/docs)** - Click here for step-by-step instructions and more insights on MQTTX.

### Prepare an MQTT Broker

- **Public Broker for Testing**: If you don't need a local MQTT Broker, use the [public MQTT 5.0 Broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker) provided by [EMQX Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud).

  ```shell
  Broker IP: broker.emqx.io
  Broker TCP Port: 1883
  Broker SSL Port: 8883
  ```

- **Local Broker**: For a local setup, [EMQX](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx) is recommended. It's an open-source, cloud-native, distributed MQTT Broker for IoT.

### Graphical User Interface

1. **Configure Your Connect**

   Access the MQTTX interface and click the `+` button in the left menu bar. Fill in the required fields in the connection form.

2. **Connect to the Broker**

   Once the connection details are set, click the `Connect` button in the upper right corner to establish a connection with your MQTT Broker.

3. **Publish and Subscribe**

   You can now test MQTT publish and subscription functions with a successful connection.

### Command Line Interface

1. **Connect**

   ```shell
   mqttx conn -h 'broker.emqx.io' -p 1883 -u 'admin' -P 'public'
   ```

2. **Subscribe**

   ```shell
   mqttx sub -t 'hello' -h 'broker.emqx.io' -p 1883
   ```

3. **Publish**

   Publish a single message.

   ```shell
   mqttx pub -t 'hello' -h 'broker.emqx.io' -p 1883 -m 'from MQTTX CLI'
   ```

   Publish multiple messages (multiline)

   ```shell
   mqttx pub -t 'hello' -h 'broker.emqx.io' -p 1883 -s -M
   ```
