[MQTTX](https://mqttx.app) is a cross-platform [MQTT 5.0](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/introduction-to-mqtt-5) client tool open sourced by [EMQ](https://www.emqx.com/en), which can run on macOS, Linux and Windows, and supports formatting MQTT payload.

[MQTTX](https://mqttx.app) simplifies test operation with the help of a familiar, chat-like interface. Itâ€™s easy and quick to create multiple, simultaneous online MQTT client connections, and can test the connection, publishing, and subscription functions of MQTT/TCP, MQTT/TLS, MQTT/WebSocket as well as other MQTT protocol features.

> [MQTT](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/the-easiest-guide-to-getting-started-with-mqtt) stands for MQ Telemetry Transport. It is a publish/subscribe, extremely simple and lightweight messaging protocol, designed for constrained devices and low-bandwidth, high-latency or unreliable networks.

### Released Packages

Download from [GitHub Releases](https://github.com/emqx/MQTTX/releases) and install it.

Alternative, you can download [here](https://www.emqx.com/downloads/MQTTX/).

## Usage

See our [documentation](https://mqttx.app/docs) or [manual](./docs/manual.md) for details.

1. Get MQTT Broker Ready.

    - If you do not need to deploy the MQTT Broker locally, you can use the [public MQTT 5.0 Broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker) provided by [EMQX Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud) for testing:

        ```shell
        Broker IP: broker.emqx.io
        Broker TCP Port: 1883
        Broker SSL Port: 8883
        ```

    - To run MQTT Broker locally, [EMQX](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/emqx) is recommended: An Open-Source, Cloud-Native, Distributed MQTT Broker for IoT.

2. Connection configuration. Click the `+` button in the left menu bar and fill in the corresponding required fields in the form.

3. After the connection information is configured, click the `Connect` button in the upper right corner to create a connection and connect to MQTT Broker.

4. After the MQTT is connected successfully, you can perform MQTT publish and subscription tests.
